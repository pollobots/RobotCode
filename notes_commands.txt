*** Notes for command-based programming ***

** Main.java and Robot.java should not be touched! They should work as configured **

** RobotContainer.java ** 

** Subsystems **
Sets up all of the components of the system and creates a wrapper around them to interact with them.

** Constants **
Try not to have any "magic" numbers in main functions!
